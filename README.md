# liri-node-app
This app is designed to search for items based on an input.
### Those input options are: 
* "spotify-this-song" (followed by a song)
* "my-twitter"
* "movie-this" (followed by a movie title)
* "do-what-it-says" (which will execute the command that is inside the random.txt file)

It will console.log() all the responses and also append them to the log.txt file.

### APIs used:
* Twitter
* OMDB
* Spotify
